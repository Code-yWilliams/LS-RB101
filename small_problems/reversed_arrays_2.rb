=begin
Write a method that takes an Array, and returns a new Array with the elements
of the original list in reverse order. Do not modify the original list.

You may not use Array#reverse or Array#reverse!,
nor may you use the method you wrote in the previous exercise.

Further Exploration:
An even shorter solution is possible by using either inject
or each_with_object. Just for fun, read about these methods
in the Enumerable module documentation, and try using one
in your reverse method.

def reverse(array)
  new_array = array.sort do |a, b|
                array.index(b) <=> array.index(a)
              end
end

p reverse([1,2,3,4]) == [4,3,2,1]          # => true
p reverse(%w(a b e d c)) == %w(c d e b a)  # => true
p reverse(['abc']) == ['abc']              # => true
p reverse([]) == []                        # => true

list = [1, 3, 2]                      # => [1, 3, 2]
new_list = reverse(list)              # => [2, 3, 1]
p list.object_id != new_list.object_id  # => true
p list == [1, 3, 2]                     # => true
p new_list == [2, 3, 1]  


# Further Exploration:
def reverso(array)
  array.each_with_object([]) do |element, result|
    result.prepend(element)
  end
end
